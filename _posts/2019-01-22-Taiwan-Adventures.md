title: Taiwan Fall 2018 Adventures
---

If you don't know much about me, I am a Taiwanese American. Taiwan is home for me and I have lived here for more than 10 years. Probably not the way you're think though, I have not lived in Taiwan for more than 5 years at a time. Due to my parent's divorce, I had the luxury to live between US and Taiwan every 4.5 years. This time being back in Taiwan was a bit different. I was no longer in school and freshly single. I was out to go on my own adventures and not have to worry about school in the back of my head, I also had to manage my spending for the very first time while traveling. I was in Taiwan for a total of 6 weeks. The first 3 were all dedicated to my parents. I really enjoy chilling with my mom and stepdad. I was pretty much living the retirement life in Taiwan. Which felt super weird because I just graduated college and about to start my full-time job in 3 months.
