title: Taiwan Fall 2018 Adventures
---

If you don't know much about me, I am a Taiwanese American. Taiwan is home for me and I have lived here for more than 10 years. Probably not the way you think though, I have not lived in Taiwan for more than 5 years at a time. Due to my parent's divorce, I had the luxury to live between US and Taiwan every 4.5 years. This time being back in Taiwan was a bit different. I was no longer in school and freshly single. I was out to go on my own adventures and not have to worry about school in the back of my head, I also had to manage my spending for the very first time while traveling. I was in Taiwan for a total of 6 weeks. The first 3 were all dedicated to my parents. I really enjoy chilling with my mom and stepdad. I was pretty much living the retirement life in Taiwan. Which felt super weird because I just graduated college and about to start my full-time job in 3 months. 

Our typical day starts off with a nice Taiwanese breakfast. I am not a breakfast person, but it's so convenient and delicious in Taiwan. Can't say no to that. My mother's elementary friend owns a breakfast shop and we go at least twice a week. It's really nice that they have kept in contact all these years. I love getting 種籽 in the morning, it's this savory sticky rice. I know it's not great for your stomach, but I wasn't going to be in Taiwan forever. Other famous Taiwanese breakfast includes 油條(fried bread sticks), 豆漿(soy milk), 蛋餅(chinese omelet).

Then we come home and look at the stock market. Very weird but I find it pretty wholesome. My parents are very big on investing in stock, so our biggest past time is talking about stocks and different investment methods.  

When lunch time rolls around, we usually get this bone marrow soup, or taiwanese beef noodle soup. Sometimes mom cooks, but eating out is cheap and more tasty. 
Next comes nap time. I am living the life. Then I usually read/code to kill time. 

At night, we usually play mahjong, bridge, or go to the theaters to watch a film. My mother decided that it would be a good idea for me to learn mahjong at a young age. My grandpa had a gambling problem his whole life and my mom was very cautious I don't gamble my life away. Her logic is that if I starting playing at a young age, I will get sick of it when I'm older. Is that true? No. Will gamble all of my savings? Hell nah. Am I less excited about playing mahjong now? I would say yes. So maybe mother's reasoning did make sense. My parents are very good at mahjong and they trained me by being fast. If I took too long on my turn, my mother would say "你太慢了,沒有人要跟你玩", which translate to "You're too slow, no one wants to play with you." It was harsh, the pressure was on and I loved it. It pushed me and now I can't stand playing mahjong with slow people. It made me think faster and find different ways to obtain a better hand. It's super thrilling.
