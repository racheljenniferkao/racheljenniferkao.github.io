Recently I have joined a private equity company, Asia Value Capital, as an intern. My tasks includes taking notes on how to start investing as a beginner,translating Chinese files and brochures into English, and coding/creating a compound calculator for WeChat Mini Program's platform. 

Our main topic today is how I created the Compound Calculator for WeChat's Mini Program.
I found this wonderful [easy tutorial](https://developers.weixin.qq.com/miniprogram/en/dev/) made by WeChat to get a basic mini program to run.
