title: Compound Calculator

Recently I have joined a private equity company, Asia Value Capital, as an intern. In a future post, I will share my experiences in AVC, along with the investment knowledge and tips I have learned from them. My intern tasks includes taking notes on how to start investing as a beginner, translating Chinese files and brochures into English, and coding/creating a compound calculator for WeChat Mini Program's platform. 

Our main topic today is how I created the Compound Calculator for WeChat's Mini Program.
I found this wonderful [easy tutorial](https://developers.weixin.qq.com/miniprogram/en/dev/) made by WeChat to get a basic mini program to run. It comes in English and Chinese.

In the tutorial above, it requires you to apply for a Mini Program account. Sadly, the application is only available in Chinese. There is another catch, if you are not a Chinese citizen, you can only apply a business/company account. That means if you are a foreigner, you can't have an account for your own personal projects. 

But Rachel, what is the meaning of this post if I can't even apply for an account? 

Don't fret, my few readers. 
The alternative or loophole is to create a [Test Account](https://developers.weixin.qq.com/miniprogram/en/dev/devtools/sandbox.html?t=18111421)!
