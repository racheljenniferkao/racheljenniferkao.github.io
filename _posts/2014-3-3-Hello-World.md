title: Compound Calculator
---

Recently I have joined a private equity company, Asia Value Capital, as an intern. My tasks includes taking notes on how to start investing as a beginner,translating Chinese files and brochures into English, and coding/creating a compound calculator for WeChat Mini Program's platform. 

Our main topic today is how I created the Compound Calculator for WeChat's Mini Program.
I found this wonderful [easy tutorial](https://developers.weixin.qq.com/miniprogram/en/dev/) made by WeChat to get a basic mini program to run.

Next you can update your site name, avatar and other options using the _config.yml file in the root of your repository (shown below).

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
