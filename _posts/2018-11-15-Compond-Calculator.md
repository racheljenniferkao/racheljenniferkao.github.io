title: Compound Calculator
---

Recently I have joined a private equity company, Asia Value Capital, as an intern. In a future post, I will share my experiences in AVC, along with the investment knowledge and tips I have learned from them. My intern tasks include taking notes on how to start investing as a beginner, translating Chinese files and brochures into English, and coding/creating a compound calculator for WeChat Mini Program's platform. 

Our main topic today is how I created the Compound Calculator for WeChat's Mini Program.

What is a WeChat's mini program?
A mini program is an app used in WeChat's platform. So think of an app inside of WeChat. It requires zero downloading, thus you do not need to go to the app/play store to download a mini program. It is already included in the WeChat Application. Pretty neat huh? 

Let's start off with getting a mini program up and running. 

I found this wonderful [easy tutorial](https://developers.weixin.qq.com/miniprogram/en/dev/) made by WeChat to get a basic mini program to run. It comes in English and Chinese.

In the tutorial above, it requires you to apply for a Mini Program account. Sadly, the application is only available in Chinese. There is another catch, if you are not a Chinese citizen, you can only apply a business/company account. That means if you are a foreigner, you can't have an account for your own personal projects. 


But Rachel, what is the meaning of this post if I can't even apply for an account? 


Don't fret, my few readers. 
The alternative or loophole is to create a [test account](https://developers.weixin.qq.com/miniprogram/en/dev/devtools/sandbox.html?t=18111421)!

After you get your test accoount, simply follow the rest of the [easy tutorial](https://developers.weixin.qq.com/miniprogram/en/dev/). That consist of downloading WeChat's devtools application, along with a quickstart demo to start your mini program. 

Now you might be wondering out of all things, why make a compound calculator? 
AVC values long term investments. Because long term investments along with compound interest rates can lead to an enormous amount of profit over time. Time in this case would be 5 years and more. So I was off and learning about the coding languages of WeChat.

The first thing I noticed is that Mini Program's language is basically html, css, and javascript. They made their own similar versions, wxml, wxss. I find this as a theme in China, their own version of Facebook, Uber, and Venmo/Square Cash. The cool thing about this is that even though mini programs are similar to apps, the langauges behind it aren't your common application languages, ex: java, swift. Mini programs are essentially websites disguise as apps.
